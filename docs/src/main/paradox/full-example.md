Full Example Code
-----------------

Here below is the complete source code from our three classes, `Greeter`, `Printer` and `HelloAkka`, that creates the sample application:

#### Greeter.java

@@snip [Greeter.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/Greeter.java)

#### Printer.java

@@snip [Printer.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/Printer.java)

#### AkkaQuickstart.java

@@snip [AkkaQuickstart.java]($g8src$/java/com/lightbend/akka/sample/AkkaQuickstart.java)

Let's move on to try this out but before we run the application we should ensure that we have some test coverage as the astute developers we are.
